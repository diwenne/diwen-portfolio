    subtitle: 'Pilot project for Cluely ‚Äî Privacy-first webcam gaze estimation',
    link: '#',
    date: 'October 2025',
    description: 'Built a lightweight, local-only gaze tracking prototype using standard webcam to infer eye/pupil position and head pose. The system classifies gaze direction (left/right/up/down/center) and emits continuous gaze vectors at 15‚Äì30 FPS. Features include swappable face/landmark detection, optional five-point calibration, temporal smoothing with confidence scores, and dual outputs: debug overlay with face/eye ROI visualization and programmatic stream (NDJSON console + optional WebSocket). Privacy-first architecture with no frame storage or network transmission, CPU-only performance with less than 100ms latency, and simple integration for immediate live gaze event streaming.',

    description: 'Co-created "Steve the Freakysaur," a Chrome Dino‚Äìstyle game controlled entirely hands-free using tongue detection through real-time facial landmark segmentation. Built during BC\'s biggest youth hackathon (Daydream Game Jam), which was also the largest Daydream event in North America, the project won 1st place out of 124 participants and 50+ projects. The game features single-player, two-player, and Flappy Bird‚Äìstyle modes, and was prototyped in Pygame before being ported to Next.js with TypeScript for web play.',

This work, which forms the scientific foundation for the Smashspeed app, was conducted under the guidance of mentors including a University of Pennsylvania M.Eng and a Stanford PhD. The paper contributes to the fields of multimedia (cs.MM) and computer vision (cs.CV) by introducing a robust methodology for object detection and state estimation of small, high-velocity objects.',

The books, starting with Python and Swift, emphasize a hands-on, project-based approach, teaching fundamental concepts with the assumption that AI tools are available to supplement learning. The series focuses on developing problem-solving skills and preparing new programmers for the modern development landscape.

The app allows badminton players to measure their smash speed by simply importing a video. The front-end was built natively with SwiftUI, and its core is a custom machine learning pipeline I engineered based on my published research.',
